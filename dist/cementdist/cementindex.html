  <p>This proposal projects a utopian future
    set within the paradigms of carbon
    neutrality, energy recovery and zero
    waste. Drawing influence from the
    industrial ecology of Kalundberg
    in Denmark, I proposed a series of
    synergistic programs within Delray
    that imagine an active future for
    existing industries in decline. This
    constellation of industrial activities
    are imagined to be operating within a
    model of industrial succession: where
    existing programs and their related
    material flows are interconnected by
    
    the circulation of raw materials, by-
    products of their waste streams and
    
    recoverable energy.diagram:process
    In this context, the cultivation of
    new remedial and recycling programs
    intentionally produces a new urban
    assembly that gives temporar y
    expression to indeter minacies,
    fluxes, possible futures. In particular,
    future urbanism is seeded by a set of
    industrial byproducts - a new set of
    urban artifacts around which future
    urbansims might be staged. These
    euphoric byproducts aim to produce
    a form of post industrial sublime beauty, breeding new hallucinations
    of possibility. I imagine a phalanstery
    composed simultaneously of
    technopositive researchers and
    industrialists in counterpoint to a
    population of circular system flaneurs
    and fanatics.<br><br>The method is to retrofit the current
    resource-energy structure for civic
    engagement and civil rights as to
    deposit for environmental and social
    sustainability and to gain recognition
    in political economic dimensions.
    Through the integration of public
    outreach programs in the testing field
    of Delray, this multi-agency field of
    actors propels citywide participants
    and a global audience for models of
    sustainable industrial futures.

    <p>Delray is a
      neighborhood in
      southwest Detroit,
      seeing Windsor
      across the Detroit
      River. Located in
      southeast Michigan,
      it accommodates a
      heavy concentration
      of interstate highways,
      water transportation,
      and cement industry.
      Delray is siloed by
      the crossing railroads
      Interstate 75 and
      the river, occupied
      with industrial
      warehouses, terminals
      and distribution
      centers. Subjected to
      planned blight, the
      neighborhood is heavily
      polluted land rendering
      the area undesirable to
      inhabit.</p>

  <h2>technicality</h2>
  <p>My early research began with a focus
    on existing cement production
    processes and their intersections with
    three major socio-ecological issues: Closed loop integration of waste
    carbon fiber, (that is commonly
    used by car manufacturers General
    Motors and Ford, with a low
    utilization rate of less than 70%,
    carbon fiber recycling possess a
    high market value and current
    research suggests this material
    could greatly enhance concrete’s
    performance. Coal ash disposal and reuse, which
    is generated in the power plant
    near Delray, it will be shut down
    by 2022, coal ash is one of the
    additives in cement production.
    And promising for harvesting
    carbon dioxide. Emerging industry-wide
    aspirations for a carbon neutral
    concrete, that have been explored
    through carbon sequestration
    models, yet currently remain
    proven at a laboratory scale
    restricted by feasibility and CO2
    supply chains. The proposal shifted to synthesize
    a series of existing industries of
    competing and complementary vested
    interests, in order to introduce a
    new urban metabolism with regard
    to resource, ecology, and habitat
    management, and its manifestation as
    “zone zero Delray”. In phase two,I propose to introduce
    a circular economy of material and
    biotech innovation and product lifespan extension driven by
    reverse logistics catalysed by the
    construction of the Gordie Howe
    bridge and in dialogue with Detroit’s
    industrial inheritances and the current
    aspirations within Southeast Michigan
    as a regional center for advanced
    manufacturing. With the incremental transformation
    of industry and enhancement of the
    desirability of the living environment
    conditioned by bio-tech greenhouse
    innovation and energy circularity, The
    project anticipates several [possible
    futures for Delray - each potential
    would respond locally to the strategy
    of byproduct “seeding” in different
    ways.
