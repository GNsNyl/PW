        <h2>Background of the Study</h2>
        <p>
            Quite often people associate texture with the quality of vocal or instrumental sounds: “He has metallic voice!” “Uilleann pipes are picturing a golden sunset.” “The music is so silky.”...

            This research proposal aims to investigate how the materiality and texture of musical instruments can be associated with music tone and how these associations can inform the design of a sensory substitution music device for deaf individuals. According to David Eagleman, our brain processes information but doesn’t care about where the data comes from. Eyes and ears are only external preceptors for information, Sensory substitution is the process of using a different sense (such as touch) to replace or makeup for the lack of another.

            The findings of this study will have implications for the development of inclusive design for deaf people, particularly in the context of sensory substitution devices for music. To be clear, people with hearing impairment can feel the vibrations, the project is NOT serving as a substitute for hearing but to enhance the experience of music appreciation for them.

<!--    <h2 style="width: 100%;text-align: center;">Research Questions</h2>-->
<!--    <p>-->
<!--        How do people with no hearing impairment perceive the material texture of sound?-->
<!--        Is there a collectively agreed material texture for each sound?-->
<!--        Will there be EEG data that convey information that indicates such association?-->

<!--        This research will employ a combination of EEG and questionnaire studies to investigate the associations between materiality and texture with musical tone. I will use ten different musical instruments, including Uilleann pipes, Violin, Viola, Cello, Erhu, Hang, Suona, Shakuhachi, Closed hi-hat, and Saxophone. These sample texture are selected based on their diversity, including wood, metal, concrete, clothes, and other materials.-->

<!--    <p>-->
<!--        The result of the is intended for amplification of conveying the sound information for hearing impaired people. The tactile sound device is composed of three parts:  arms of vibrator with texture patches, processor to differentiate different sound tones.-->
