        <h5>Change of Mind</h5>
        <p>My starting point was to write about the commodification of nature through carbon trading. But whenever I closed my eyes and started outlining, I saw faces, fading faces and villages. My memory of grandma is my only clear tie with my hometown village. I want to document it before it pales off. Not until the middle of the writing did I find that her story is so attuned to the time of massive changes I was too within to see. Jason Moore illustrates as he adopts a socio-ecological perspective that  “one’s point of departure - nature? society? the relations between them? - shapes the range of possible destinations.”<sup>1</sup> The outcome of this socially registered writing is expected to be different from one from an ecological perspective. However, this is not to sever the ecological aspects from carbon trading, this is indeed a situation of relations on which we premised. In this regard, I see this writing of stories as a needle pincushion, recasting theories and critique of labor, economy, ecology, and society.
        </p>
        <img class = 'imgs' src="img/pin.png">
        <p>After reading the American Lucifers by Jeremy Zallen, I hesitate to “conflate relations of oppression,” but here, this IS a typical rural story, a prototypical struggle shared by 292,510,000 migrant workers<sup>2</sup> in the cities and their close family members stationed behind. I do not claim or even attempt to comment on the lopsided developments of urban and rural areas but rather see them as the socio-political terrain in which the rhetoric of carbon trade situates itself. The work of this paper is to contextualize the carbon market (using the case of Anji) in the well-studied socio-economic models of Polanyian market theory and the Lewis dual sector model, both of which constitute the theoretical foundation and analytical framework of the transformation of China, and recast Marxist critique of political economy in the process of commodification of nature.

        <h5>Choice of Word: Commodification or Commoditization?</h5>
        <p>
          The choice of words implies and enforces normative importance on the subject matter under discussion. In describing the process of making nature a commodity for sale, two words are up for bid: commodification and commoditization. I could not find a systematic analysis of their difference, and word formation gives more syllabic explanations regarding -ize and -ify.<sup>3</sup> Below are some efforts made by other people.
        </p>
        <p>According to New Oxford American Dictionary:
          Commoditization: the action or process of treating something as a mere commodity: he warned against commoditization of the ancient Indian practice.
          Commodification: the action or process of treating something as a mere commodity: he warned against commoditization of the ancient Indian practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to a blog in Investopedia,
          “Commoditization refers to the process of making something into a commodity. More broadly, commodification is taking something that previously was not available in the market and making it so…”<sup>4</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          According to DiffBw:
          As a noun, commoditization is "The transformation of something into a commodity". On the other hand, commodification is "The assignment of a commercial value to something previously valueless."<sup>5</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Wikipedia:
          One way to summarize the difference is that commoditization is about proprietary things becoming generic, whereas commodification is about nonsaleable things becoming saleable. In social sciences, particularly anthropology, the term is used interchangeably with commodification to describe the process of making commodities out of anything that was not available for trade previously.<sup>6</sup>
        </p>
        <p>There is also debate over the Marxism embeddedness of the words, although different people hold different opinions, Douglas Rushkoff argues that commodification is a Marxist term<sup>7</sup> whereas Braden R. Allenby states the opposite that “Commoditization is a strange word. Frequently found in Marxist discourse, it means…”<sup>8</sup>

        <h4>Section 1 SCALE-UP: STORY, STORIES</h4>
        <h5>Year two Thousand Something, the Wicker Basket and Mushroom “Economy”:</h5>
        <p>
          I spent my early summer and winter breaks in small villages with my grandparents, powering up by doing nothing. We lived in the northern part of inland China. Thanks to the mountainous topography, we got about ten-minute heavy rain almost every day, and the sky cleared up for the rest of the day. This is the perfect condition for mushroom prosperity: humid enough for its growth and gentle so that it is not washed away. Grandma would get in the forest and collect mushrooms every other day, and I could tag along if I felt like it. All the time, she carried an empty wicker basket, spacious enough to put me inside, and got back a basket full of mushrooms, hazelnuts, and some unnamed grasses. Risking overgeneralization, the most common “wall decoration” in northern rural China was those handcrafted wicker baskets of various sizes, weathered. I don’t see them often today anymore. Made devoid of material and structural mechanics, in my grandma's hands, they seemed steady enough to carry the mountain. After not very long, I earned myself a mini-basket for participation award; happily, I became “well” equipped to collect.
        </p>
        <p>
          The newly collected mushrooms must be cleaned and flatted under the sun to avoid molding. Depending on the weather conditions, but most often, after two or three weeks, we would bag them to sell. Different varieties of mushrooms sold at different prices; for me, this wasn’t given knowledge back then. I learned at the “business negotiation table.” There had always been men on a motorcycle, traveling miles across villages to buy mushrooms, hazelnuts, etc. I called them the “mushroom brokers.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That was almost 20 years ago. A gunny sack of mushrooms from a month's labor, compact of my height, could only sell for 30 Yuan (about $4.5). That was already the price after haggling. From their “dance” of negotiation, I learned about yield and rainfall, price, and temperature. The mushroom broker came already burdening the motorcycle but always managed to make space for grandma’s bloated bags. Grandma was illiterate but could do the math; however, she ensured that I was always around in case her untrained math skills failed her at critical points.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lived in the city most of the year, but never had I been so close to the “market” while I was in the distant village, assisting grandma in selling mushrooms. Many years later, I learned the term “invisible hands of the market” in junior high politics class. At that time, the “hand” was talking through the broker’s mouth about words he probably had picked up from other merchants and handed grandma the compensation for the summers’ labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing important is that you don’t sell mushrooms to make a living; the mountain was not generous enough to have that many mushrooms to support the entire family. Grandparents live off the modest income as a teacher and their rice and corn field. Collecting mushrooms was only to fill in what meant to be a recessive season of the year – between spring sowing-seeding and fall harvesting.
        </p>

        <h5>
          “Rural Renewal,” Depeasantization, and Migrant Workers
        </h5>
        <p>
          My grandparents moved to the city in 2005 when my parents could finally afford another apartment in the city (small town, to be more precise) and wished their parents could take early retirement from farm work. My grandparents’ moving cut down my thin tie to my hometown, from two stays each year to one every two or three years. Their going to the city was normal in a special way: of the many migrants from villages, they were in a less frequent age group. That was the time of booming development in China's large cities; young people rushed into big cities<sup>9</sup> in the hope of making good fortune, leaving the seniors and children in the village for lack money to support education and health care in big cities, and the restriction of household registration (Hukou<sup>10</sup>). At about the time when “grandmas” stopped collecting for the poor price that mushrooms had become, the mountain grew at a renewed intensity and unkempt, swallowing down previous trails; the farmland was not as occupied as it used to be, but some youngsters might still come back farming for less than two weeks and head back to cities without water break; green the nature might be, lonesomeness was all I saw. Contrary to the exponential diversification of mountain vegetation, the villages homogenized to an age combination of 15- and 60+, aging, with its prevalence sweeping across the country.

        <p>Like that, my hometown, a space of primary-commodity production, receded on the layered parchment of progress. The strong and the young stopped their peasantry and joined the “labor reserve army” in cities,<sup>11</sup> expected to break the material separation and seek upward mobility, leaving our village a labor resource hinterland. The actualized depeasantization took off along with the densified tapestry of connectivity and information fluidity, and some places were rendered invisible in the circulatory system. The moving of migrant workers conforms to the Dual Sector model<sup>12</sup> of the traditional agricultural sector and a modern industrial sector formulated by Sir William Arthur Lewis. Inferring from the elasticity of agricultural products as necessities less than 1, in my grandma’s case, the price of mushrooms stopped being attractive to her anymore, and farmers’ income lagged behind the overall income (earning) and inflation (spending) rate, forcing farmers to seek jobs in cities. Price scissors, meaning the inequity of prices among agricultural products versus industrial products, further discourage farmers’ productivity. The Dual Sector model describes the process that surplus labor from the agricultural sector is drawn and simultaneously contributes to the growth of the industrial sector. The migration has deeper roots in the incongruence between industrialization and the lagged behind urbanization, or what the World Bank termed in 1982 “industrialization without urbanization,” which has deep spatio-political embeddedness.
        </p>
        <p>Moving into large cities, migrant workers take on jobs in construction sites and gig economy. The modality of turning imperative to make a living into the urban flow and concrete spectacle underpins the process of logistical urbanization. People were “voluntarily” forced into the relationship of production, the regime of labor and capital, and the falsified promise of automation and modernization. Young former peasants struggle in that their “only source of income is the sale of his labor-power” indispensable to “the whole class of buyers.”<sup>13</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the story of grandma’s participation in the commodity network as a farmer, her unalienated labor, and the stories of the subsumed farmers I see through hers. The industrialization and socialist economic regime concerted the geospatial and dual-sectoral reconfiguration of labor. I did not think this was relevant to carbon trading; however, carbon capture in practice demands the economistic metric of human labor, and carbon or in its more tangible form – carbon capturing plants constitute the material axis and unity of labor and nature. The force atlas of the carbon market seems to pull migrant worker back to rural labor with the promise of carbon compensation; the next section traces the socio-economic genealogy of carbon trading in Anji and quantitively analyze the legitimacy of its promise.

        <h4>Section 2 SCALE-DOWN: MARKETS, MARKET</h4>
        <h5>Carbon Trading, Fictitious Commodity in the Dual Sector?</h5>
        <p>Payment for ecosystem services (PES) is an environmental managerial approach to facilitate ecosystem conservation and restoration using monetary compensation,<sup>14</sup> whose details I will spare here. In their article, Milder, Scherr, and Bracer emphasize PES’ potential to alleviate poverty and be beneficial for low-income people both in the program and outside. To localize the conversation within the social context of China – the dual sector and imbalanced rural and urban development and socialist economy, I focus the discussion on the Anji Liangshan Bamboo Forest Carbon Collection and Storage Trading Center established in December 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          In December 2021, the Anji Liangshan Bamboo Forest Carbon Collection and Storage Trading Center was established, marking the official operation of the country's first county-level bamboo forest carbon collection and storage trading platform.
          The transaction and storage of the bamboo forest carbon sink need to go through Anji Liangshan Bank. The bank purchases carbon sinks from village collectives (farmers) and then trades them to enterprises. Up to now, Anji Liangshan Bank has completed the first phase of transactions of 142,400 mu<sup>15</sup> of bamboo forest with three enterprises in the county at a total of 416,000 yuan. Of the revenue of about 147,000 yuan, Anji Liangshan Bank will compensate 80% of the net income to the village collectives and guide the villagers to interplant, interbreed, and harvest scientifically.<sup>16</sup>
