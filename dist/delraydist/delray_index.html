<p>This proposal projects a utopian future
    set within the paradigms of carbon
    neutrality, energy recovery and zero
    waste. Drawing influence from the
    industrial ecology of Kalundberg
    in Denmark, I proposed a series of
    synergistic programs within Delray
    that imagine an active future for
    existing industries in decline. This
    constellation of industrial activities
    are imagined to be operating within a
    model of industrial succession: where
    existing programs and their related
    material flows are interconnected by
    the circulation of raw materials, byproducts of their waste streams and
    recoverable energy.diagram:process
    In this context, the cultivation of
    new remedial and recycling programs
    intentionally produces a new urban
    assembly that gives temporar y
    expression to indeter minacies,
    fluxes, possible futures. In particular,
    future urbanism is seeded by a set of
    industrial byproducts - a new set of
    urban artifacts around which future
    urbansims might be staged. These
    euphoric byproducts aim to produce
    a form of post industrial sublime beauty, breeding new hallucinations
    of possibility. I imagine a phalanstery
    composed simultaneously of
    technopositive researchers and
    industrialists in counterpoint to a
    population of circular system flaneurs
    and fanatics.<br><br>The method is to retrofit the current
    resource-energy structure for civic
    engagement and civil rights as to
    deposit for environmental and social
    sustainability and to gain recognition
    in political economic dimensions.
    Through the integration of public
    outreach programs in the testing field
    of Delray, this multi-agency field of
    actors propels citywide participants
    and a global audience for models of
    sustainable industrial futures.

<p>Delray is a
    neighborhood in
    southwest Detroit,
    seeing Windsor
    across the Detroit
    River. Located in
    southeast Michigan,
    it accommodates a
    heavy concentration
    of interstate highways,
    water transportation,
    and cement industry.
    Delray is siloed by
    the crossing railroads
    Interstate 75 and
    the river, occupied
    with industrial
    warehouses, terminals
    and distribution
    centers. Subjected to
    planned blight, the
    neighborhood is heavily
    polluted land rendering
    the area undesirable to
    inhabit.</p>

    <h2>technicality</h2>
    <p>My early research began with a focus
        on existing cement production
        processes and their intersections with
        three major socio-ecological issues: Closed loop integration of waste
        carbon fiber, (that is commonly
        used by car manufacturers General
        Motors and Ford, with a low
        utilization rate of less than 70%,
        carbon fiber recycling possess a
        high market value and current
        research suggests this material
        could greatly enhance concrete’s
        performance. Coal ash disposal and reuse, which
        is generated in the power plant
        near Delray, it will be shut down
        by 2022, coal ash is one of the
        additives in cement production.
        And promising for harvesting
        carbon dioxide. Emerging industry-wide
        aspirations for a carbon neutral
        concrete, that have been explored
        through carbon sequestration
        models, yet currently remain
        proven at a laboratory scale
        restricted by feasibility and CO2
        supply chains. The proposal shifted to synthesize
        a series of existing industries of
        competing and complementary vested
        interests, in order to introduce a
        new urban metabolism with regard
        to resource, ecology, and habitat
        management, and its manifestation as
        “zone zero Delray”. In phase two,I propose to introduce
        a circular economy of material and
        biotech innovation and product lifespan extension driven by
        reverse logistics catalysed by the
        construction of the Gordie Howe
        bridge and in dialogue with Detroit’s
        industrial inheritances and the current
        aspirations within Southeast Michigan
        as a regional center for advanced
        manufacturing. With the incremental transformation
        of industry and enhancement of the
        desirability of the living environment
        conditioned by bio-tech greenhouse
        innovation and energy circularity, The
        project anticipates several [possible
        futures for Delray - each potential
        would respond locally to the strategy
        of byproduct “seeding” in different
        ways.
