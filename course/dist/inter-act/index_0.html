    The specific research topic proposed here lies under the umbrella of decentralization in design. To avoid the “metaphor” pitfall discussed by Tuck and Yang that “the easy absorption, adoption, and transposing of” an emancipatory term contributes to the concretization of the existing power structure. The research proposes to see decentralization not as a point of destination but as a praxis toward certain properties and an antidote to the overcentralized society.<br><br>
    Design decision casts a normative implication and prescriptive weight on the individuals’ life: I will spare the details of Winner’s provocation of the political qualities of technical things in Do artifacts have politics; meanwhile, design as a nonhuman “takes over the selective attitudes of those who engineered them.” In response, the project provides a nexus of communication, technology, and participatory design practice, accessible to all through a website. The project Inter-act harbor the prowess of mass computing machines and the empathic human mind to make design inference and interventions.<br><br>
    Technically, the project website pipelines and ports the workflow:
        <li> Generating actionable base map from an aerial map using image segmentation and masks;</li>
        <li>Auto-generation of the urban elements from photo inputs using domain transfer and port it with tensorflow.js; (in the current version, I am providing the elements)</li>
        <li>Smooth experience of participatory design through human-computer interaction (current project progress)</li>
        <li>Access the urban features based on the co-produced urban configuration.</li><br><br>
