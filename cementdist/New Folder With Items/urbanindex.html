				<h2 class="myDIV">Reading of Practices of Power and Semiotics</h2>
				<!-- <h3>location: Washington D C, US<br>medium: graphic<br>type: urban study, social equity, semiotic, politics</h3> -->
				<p class="hide">This series of drawings is designed to portray the contentious frictions among protesters, politicians and mass media “bystanders” in the midst of the social upheaval of racial justice protests, pandemic stress of Covid-19, and the US presidential election campaign. In the particular case of the political epicenter of the country, the occupation and renaming of the 16th Street in front of the White House set an unprecedented contested urban backdrop in Washington D.C. By capturing the accumulated tension among multiple constituencies and agents, a series of drawings intend to build on the active role of narratives in shaping the demographics of urban space, the subjectivity of citizenship and its nuanced political implications.<br>The political instrumentalization of the mural commissioned by Mayor Bowser on 16th Street NW, the current Black Lives Matter Plaza, puts into conversation the agency of public space, its digital equivalence, and the balance of politics in its social dynamics. Other than the rhetorical glorification of the BLM Mural, its implementation remains still controversial under the purview of its socioeconomic, political and geo-spatial context. The graphic novel compiles interpretations from various political standings in the fleeting urban landscapes that the mural casts, with a particular appreciation of its indeterminacies and its latent energy. Under scrutiny are, beyond its physical presence, the political connotations of its urban setting, and the insurgent occupations that keep reconstructing its urban identity.<br>Urban iconography is constructed by vested interests and representational immediacy. The fifty-foot high letters that take over 2 blocks in front of the White House, St. John's Church where former President Donald Trump had his controversial photo op, the street name sign “Black Lives Matter Plaza” erected by Mayor Bowser as part of the renaming process, all of which perpetuate the “negotiation of powers, rights, and vulnerabilities”. The communicating apparatus “BLACK LIVES MATTER” draws its theoretical basis from semiotics, in the way that the spatial forms as signifiers communicate with the ideology as signifieds. The three-word banner recalls a history of systemic inequality and bureaucratic regimentation on African Americans. The figure of Incarceration Demographics and Police Violence manifests the structural injustice in the most ostensible and violent manner. The color yellow is stimulating and vision-enhancing, especially in combination with the dark asphalt; but more importantly as the US road symbol does, yellow conveys a general warning message. No detail in this construct is exempt from narrative, the mural inauguration day and renaming of the plaza, June 5th, unveils another connection, it is Breonna Taylor’s birthday, a 26-year-old African-American woman, victim of police brutality.<br>In order to leverage the biased and regulated interpretations, the research resorts to the dynamics of interpenetrating media-reality-social media narratives in an unfolding sequence of many stories at once. What mayor Bowser called an instrument for statement to be heard, part of the BLM DC protesters labeled it as “a performative gesture” and “a deviation from real policy change.” Trump tweets accused Bowser as “grossly incompetent”, at the same time that different religious organizations filed a federal lawsuit against Bowser and the renaming of the public space. The encompassing sign leads to unintended and unexpected events that sometimes go beyond the legislative imagination, reflecting the commons as a “dynamic and responsive” that “unfolds events in time.” The increasing digital presence of mediations from various agencies ushers in a time of increasing connectivity and global participatory action, affording the mural an intense influential capacity. The mural in DC has mimicking effects on protesters, leading to the street mural of Black Lives Matter in hundreds of cities worldwide buttressing the solidarity. The concerted struggle and turmoil bring into conversation the meaningful output of on-site physical information, the profuse interpretations and occupations, and the media-mediated narrative, perceived by individuals remotely and independently. Acts of insurgency transcend geographic boundaries render variants attuned to respective political contexts. Events that interact with the sign in confrontation, juxtaposition, and intersection constantly in an attempt to recall the anthropological values and ideological functions of the struggle of African Americans in the United States. A tentative format that reconstructs fragments of an undesired reality at the time that reveals opaque internal relations and structures.

				Commemorating Mundanity and Solecism:
				
				“Many of us are striving to produce a blend of all the cultures which seems today to be in clash with one another. No culture can live if it attempts to be exclusive.”
				
				—Mahatma Gandhi, conference at Allahabad, April 5, 1936
				
				
				Throughout 2019, the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth extended across the Indian geography. In a time of growing national sociopolitical polarization, Gandhi’s legacy continues to be appropriated, celebrated, and problematized through the scrutinizing of his views on religious pluralism, environmental stewardship, activism, caste, and race. The city of Ahmedabad held special significance as Gandhiji’s karmabhumi, the field of action during the formative years of his political and spiritual leadership. It was on the12 banks of the Sabarmati River between the British jail and the crematoriu grounds where he settled the Sabarmati Ashram in 1917. Embracin satyagraha, the practice of holding on to truth andnonviolentresistance the Ashram served as the strategic center for th Indian freedom struggle. Gandhi lived there until 1930, when he departed for the Salt March, never to return.
				
				The announcement by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of plans to remake the Sabarmati Ashram into a 32-acre “world-class memorial” is part of a carefully curated project to co- opt Gandhi’s legacy into a renewed Hindu nationalist agenda. Calling it a land grab, activists warn that the redevelopment will alter the spirit of the institution, and many fear that the ideals of simplicity and austerity that once defined the Ashram will be forever lost and this site of pilgrimage will turn into yet another tourist resort. By intentionally redefining the principles shaping the formation of secular modern India and its commitment to diversity, the new memorial aims to reshape collective memory in the service of a divisive political agenda of estrangement and exclusion. These official plans and their highly controlled narrative have exacerbated the social reproduction of segregation, further challenging the ability for different groups to coexist during the most divisive time in India’s history. For the city to remain the karmabhumi Gandhi once envisioned, by embodying comfort with alterity and otherness, implies tacit agreement on the importance of building spaces for exercising dissent and the coexistence of alternate, more just futures.
				
				In the race to become a global city, the disregard for disenfranchised citizens via eviction, relocation, and ghettoization renders Ahmedabad into a land of confrontation and provides an opportunity for insurgent appropriations. The damning scale and fast pace of the urban erasure have wreaked havoc on the few remaining traces of urban nature and other spaces that cultivated the coexistence of diverse species and lifestyles. The celebrated and photogenic Sabarmati Riverfront Development project has involved the concretization and commodification of the river and removal of 11,360 households.1 The continued threat of eviction for slum dwellers is fueled by the promise of a better, more hygienic city where poverty is not on display. Together with these massive forced removals to materialize infrastructure projects, the powerful force of nature and its unpredictable changes, and the creation of “special political zones”2 as a paradigmatic outcome of religious- political violence3, Amdavadis agonize with the progressive erasure of urban spaces where they can exercise their citizenship.
				
				Alterity and the Commemoration of Polyphony4
				
				The story of Sabarmati Ashram is self-fulfilling. It delivers a utopian and highly curated image of an India that was and that one wished for. In the production, reproduction, and mediation of that imagery, the Gandhian legacy is reinforced through rehearsal and repetition to develop a perfected narrative of triumphant nation-making. In reaction to the ideological exercise and self- contained account captured at the Ashram, the city offers two ever- unfolding stories that complement and juxtapose each other, one of conflict and confrontation and the other of citizenhood and collaboration. This dialectical narrative challenges the prevalent, authoritative voice, fields unsolicited accounts, and equips the inaudible with a megaphone. With it, the city itself is the medium to amplify and diversify how we register Gandhi’s legacy under today’s socio-political, cultural, and religious conflicts. The interplay of moments, places, and lives insinuates, iterates, accentuates, and compounds the disparate stories of the many who once helped build the Ashram and its dream of an inclusive society, but who today remain invisible.
				
				The notion of karmabhumi under the lens of Henri Lefebvre’s perceived- conceived-lived triad5 offers a productive lens to scrutinize alterity in relation to the incongruity among the top-down “representations of space,”6 divergent and capricious urban conditions, and projected memorial “social practice.” Contemporary representations of space in Ahmedabad cling to rapid urbanization to attain global status7 and impose ideological and spatial barriers only surmountable to restricted groups of people. The neglect of the right to the city for a majority of the population through political and socio-spatial tactics incarcerates the Gandhian philosophy of reunion, where hearts come together to enable collective action. Spread across the city in the spaces of the quotidian, these dwindling moments enable the serendipitous encounter of citizens with each other and their congregation before dispersal. By shifting focus from the polyphony of monuments and memorials, which impose a unifying reading of the past, these alternate city fragments of the everyday can be seen as a shriek for conversation and the reenactment of Gandhi in Amdavadi’s public life. In them, citizens’ voices may yet be too weak to be heard and their intentions too unconscious to be registered as commemorative, but their actions embody a quest for the celebration of otherness.The alterity project is a so-called polyphonic account of the geography of mundanity within Ahmedabad, catalyzing the tension between the official and unofficial accounts of Gandhi’s legacy. Alterity approaches the formulation of Gandhi's memorial by delineating the banal, everyday moments where people have heartened to Gandhi’s words and whispered back. Turning everyday city life into a living memorial simultaneously reflects and situates citizens’ agency in dialogue with ever-changing urban conditions. Building on Dolores Hayden’s assertion that place makes memories cohere in complex ways, the rapid transformation of the city in recent years complicates citizens’ experiences of the urban landscape “intertwining the sense of place and the politics of space.”9 These conversational moments, taciturn or loquacious, are identifiable in both spatial and social realms, denoting both visible and latent political structures. Drawing on the promise of citizens’ initiation, this act aims to restructure the present narratology of10urban segregation and confrontation by seeding “wander thirst”11 beyond the established demarcation lines inscribed in the city’s grounds. This entails designing to celebrate alterity, challenging and distorting current spatial conventions and programming expectations for what a memorial aims to be.

				The deviation from the conventional is nothing rebellious, but the manifestation of an individual's unpreparedness for untamed urban transformation. Otherness necessitates an indiscriminate account of imagination similar to Foucault’s Rousseauist account: “In the dream of there no longer exist any zones of darkness, zones established by the privileges of royal power or prerogative of some corporation....”12 Situational and improvisational, this act focuses on impending and ongoing moments of alterity, where an individual speaks to the entire society and one’s fantasy is projected in the context of collective imagination . This reading of the Gandhian legacy in Ahmedabad is a continuum whose spatiality lies not in geographical proximity, but emotional and programmatic fluidity, shifting temporality, kindred appreciation for interaction, and dynamic exchange and communication.

					The Naked City (1948)</h2>
				<!-- <h3>location: Washington D C, US<br>medium: graphic<br>type: urban study, social equity, semiotic, politics</h3> -->
				<p class="hide">
					The scholarly romance with urban and cinematic art forms a semantical reciprocity and a dynamic imaginary production, rendering film as an alternate urbanity and a heterotopia entrance.
					
					Cinematic narrative generates a tessellation of multiple spatio-geographically unassociated and yet tense agencies in the urban setting. In the case of The Naked City directed by Jules Dassin, the investigation of the death of Jean Dexter led to a sequential navigation through the city and the horizon of civic life. These cinematic lens curates a cognitive map of New York City, through neighborhoods of various demographic features and imprints, identities, and identifications. “Personae of the cinematic city”1 is an artifact of both the city as it is and the imbricated rhythm in studio. It is composed of a highly selective footprint of investigation, and “interrelatedness of events, environments, people, and actions”2, and the citizens that are outside of the constellation. The recurring metaphor of a 5-cent story captures what Simmel wrote in his The Metropolis and Mental Life the self-defendant mental state of blasé3. Individuals have developed an indifferent attitude toward external stimulus, the life and death of a person become an entertaining story after dinner.
